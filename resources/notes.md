1. Referential Transparency:
```
Definition: An expression e is referentially transparent if, for all programs p, 
all occurrences of e in p can be replaced by the result of evaluating e without affecting the meaning of p. 
A function f is pure if the expression f(x) is referentially transparent for all referentially transparent x.
